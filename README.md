# REST API for reddit submissions from the NBA community
www.reddit-nba-api.stream

## Description

This RESTFUL API returns reddit submissions JSON data including title, timestamp, submission url and a unit of measure used to determine the significance of the submission. 

The database of these submissions deemed significant were generated by a process that looked at all NBA reddit submissions from within all 31 communities. The submissions were selected by a process that identified spikes in submission activity and then extracted the highest rated submission in that time frame.

The code that identified and generated these submissions is [here](https://github.com/nabeel-h/port.io/blob/master/Notebooks/nba_reddit/On%20generating%20significant%20submission%20dates%20from%20a%20subreddit%20period.ipynb).

The API offers the following __GET__ methods to retrieve specific data from the postgresql db.
